# Introduction

Bolero is a fuzzing and property testing front-end framework for Rust.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing), fuzzing is described as:

> Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks.

`bolero`'s goal is to make implementing high-quality tests as painless and approachable as possible.
